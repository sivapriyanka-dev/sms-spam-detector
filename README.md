## Project Overview

**SpamShield** is a full-stack AI-powered web application that detects whether an SMS message is **Spam** or **Ham (Safe)** using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

The project began as an NLP classification model and was later transformed into a production-ready full-stack web application with a modern responsive user interface.

Users can paste suspicious SMS messages and instantly receive spam detection predictions through a live deployed web application.

```

Result:
```text
🚨 Spam
```

**Ham**
```text
Hey, where are you? Call me when you're free.
```

Result:
```text
✅ Ham
```
